In this assignment, Ali and I experimented the policy gradient methods on Mountain car problem, as suggested in chapter 13 of the textbook. We first implemented the REINFORCE which is a policy gradient algorithm based on the complete return as in Monte Carlo algorithm. We compared the result of REINFORCE with or without the baseline. We then implemented the actor-critic methods with 1-step return or with eligibility trace. Note that we cut off the learning in each episode if time_step is over 200 in all algorithms for faster learning.
