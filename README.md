In this assignment, Ali and I experimented the policy gradient methods on Mountain car problem and easy21 (a simplified version of blackjack), as suggested in chapter 13 of the textbook. We first implemented the REINFORCE which is a policy gradient algorithm based on the complete return as in Monte Carlo algorithm. We compared the result of REINFORCE with or without the baseline. We then implemented the actor-critic methods with 1 or n step return. Lastly, we used actor-critic algorithm with eligibility trace and  λλ -return.
